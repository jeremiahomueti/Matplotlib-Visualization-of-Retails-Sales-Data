# Matplotlib Visualization of Retail Sales Data

This project demonstrates the use of **Matplotlib** and **Pandas** for data visualization in Python using a retail sales dataset.  
It explores different types of charts to reveal insights about sales, profit, customer demographics, and store performance.

## Project Overview

The dataset (`retail.xlsx`) contains 2,000 records with columns such as:
- `region`
- `product_category`
- `store_type`
- `month`
- `customer_age`
- `customer_gender`
- `quantity`
- `unit_price`
- `sales`
- `profit`
- `rating`

Using **Matplotlib**, this notebook visualizes the data through six different chart types.

## Visualizations

| S/N | Chart Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **1** | Bar Chart | Total Sales by Region | Compare sales across regions |
| **2** | Horizontal Bar Chart | Average Profit by Product Category | Identify top-performing product categories |
| **3** | Pie Chart | Distribution of Transactions by Store Type | Show proportion of transactions by store type |
| **4** | Scatter Plot | Sales vs. Profit | Explore the relationship between sales and profitability |
| **5** | Line Chart | Total Sales by Month | Identify monthly trends or seasonality in sales |
| **6** | Histogram | Distribution of Customer Ages | Understand customer age distribution |
| **7** | Line Chart (Multiple Lines) | Sales & Profit Trends over Months | Compare how profit tracks alongside sales |
| **8** | Customized Bar Chart | Profit by Region (Custom Colors) | Highlight profitability differences across regions with styled bars |
| **9** | Subplots | (1) Bar Chart: Sales by Product Category<br>(2) Pie Chart: Customer Gender Distribution | Display two insights side by side |
| **10** | Scatter Plot (Colored) | Quantity vs. Sales, Colored by Region | Show how regions differ in sales–quantity relationships |
